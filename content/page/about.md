## About

I'm an American from Mount Vernon, Indiana. After graduating, I left the US to teach English in Hong Kong and now I'm beginning to apply for postgraduate programs. My long-term goal is to begin a career in the field of **financial data science**. My portfolio is an ongoing commitment that I hope to add to while working and studying. 

I became interested in **financial data science** when I was close to finishing my undergraduate degree. After graduating, I decided I wanted to take some time to make sure a career in data science was what I really wanted. So, I decided to travel and engage in some of my other interests while studying programming and data science. During my time in Hong Kong, some of my interests were fleeting and I didn't feel the desire to pursue them, but I kept coming back to my data science projects.

## Education

I studied Mathematics and Statistics at Purdue University, from which I graduated in 2016 with a Bachelor of Science and a minor in Political Science. In my Fall 2014 semester, I spent a semester at Yonsei University in South Korea on an exchange program. 

After I graduated, I obtained my CELTA (Certificate in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) from Cambridge. Currently, I'm in Hong Kong working as an English teacher and applying for graduate programs. 

I'm currently a student at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/). I'm a part-time student getting a Master of Science in [Financial Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/pg/programme/p68).
