## About

I'm an American from Mount Vernon, Indiana. After graduating, I left the US to teach English in Hong Kong and now I'm beginning to apply for postgraduate programs. My long-term goal is to begin a career in the field of data science. My portfolio is an ongoing commitment that I hope to add to while working and studying. 

I became interested in data science when I was close to finishing my undergraduate degree. After graduating, I decided I wanted to take some time to make sure a career in data science was what I really wanted. So, I decided to travel and engage in some of my other interests while studying programming and data science. During my time in Hong Kong, some of my interests were fleeting and I didn't feel the desire to pursue them, but I kept coming back to data science. Now that I'm sure that data science is what I want to do, I'm in the process of applying to graduate programs. 

## School

I studied Mathematics and Statistics at Purdue University, from which I graduated in 2016 with a Bachelor of Science and a minor in Political Science. In my Fall 2014 semester, I spent a semester at Yonsei University in South Korea on an exchange program. 

After I graduated, I obtained my CELTA (Certificate in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) from Cambridge. Currently, I'm in Hong Kong working as an English teacher and applying for graduate programs.
