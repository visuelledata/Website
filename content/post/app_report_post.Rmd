## Automated App Reports

### Summary: 
This project is to generate automated self-written reports for my phone usage. You can see the R code [on my GitHub page](https://github.com/visuelledata/AppReports). 

### How it works: 
1) **Data collection:**  
All of the data is collected on my phone using a script created on [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&hl=en). This script logs the time I spend on any app, then uploads it to Google Sheets. 

2) **The report:**  
The report is designed and generated in R as an HTML file. It pulls the data from Google Sheets, cleans the data, and then generates a report using it.  

3) **Sending:**  
Every month Tasker runs a script from my phone to turn on my PC, then sends a message to the EventGhost (Windows automation program). EventGhost then runs a shell command to run the [create_report.R](https://github.com/visuelledata/AppReports/blob/master/create_report.R) script. The report is then generated and emailed using R.

**Note:** Some of the lines don't represent apps. Many of them are names of books, which I intentionally included.
